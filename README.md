# BirdClassification
Applying Fourier analysis to understand the acoustic properties of different bird species. The goal is to train a deep learning model to classify species. 

Bird audio was obtained from the [New Zealand Department of Conservation/Te Papa Atawhai website](https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/birds/bird-songs-and-calls/) and [xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org/)
